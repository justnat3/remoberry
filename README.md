# Remoberry

## Purpose
So I can be lazy. Perfect for a college student with a computer & bed right next to each other.

## Getting Started

1. On your computer

You will be greeted with a QRCode when you launch the application. This will give you a link to the mobile UI(your remote)

2. On your phone

Next you when you scan the QRCode and connect to your computer. You wil be be given a text area to stick a **youtube** URL into. This will play the video automagically.
